# ada-subset-compiler-prototype

A compiler for a subset of the Ada programming language.

You may run the script testValidation.sh, and then you may run the executable generated, if you want to compiler a specific file. The script has options which can be enabled.

For clarification, my early contributions (up until and mostly including the semantic analysis)  were committed by my colleague.
